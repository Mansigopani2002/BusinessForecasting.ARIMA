This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(fpp)
library(fpp2)
library(forecast)
library(readr)

Data <- read.csv("C:/Users/mansi gopani/Downloads/dataset_assign.csv")
Data_ts <- ts(Data$Monthlybeerproduction)
plot(Data_ts)
ndiffs(Data_ts)
#The data shows a clear seasonal pattern that repeats over time, which is common in production or sales, where certain months consistently have higher or lower outputs. Additionally, the ups and downs in the data seem to get bigger as time goes on, suggesting that beer production becomes more variable over the years. The ARIMA model is designed to capture these patterns and trends to make accurate predictions about future beer production.
tsdisplay(Data_ts)
ts_diff <- diff(Data_ts, differences=1)
plot(ts_diff)
tsdisplay(ts_diff)
data_auto <- auto.arima(Data_ts, trace=TRUE, stepwise = FALSE)
data_auto
attributes(data_auto)
plot(forecast(data_auto,h=5,level=c(99.5)))
#Residual Analysis
Acf(data_auto$residuals)
Box.test(residuals(data_auto), lag=20, type="Ljung")
plot.ts(residuals(data_auto))
hist(data_auto$residuals)
tsdiag(data_auto)
accuracy <- accuracy(data_auto)
print(accuracy)
